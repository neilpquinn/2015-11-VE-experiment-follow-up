    "This analysis follows up on the work done by Aaron Halfaker in his [May 2015 visual editor experiment](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study). In that study, all the new accounts created on the English Wikipedia during one week [were divided evenly](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research_talk:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/Work_log/2015-06-05) between a treatment group which was automatically offered the new visual editor alongside the existing wikitext editor and control group which was not.\n",
    "\n",
    "That experiment helped win the English Wikipedia community's consent to start giving the visual editor to new users automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "In turn, I am expanding Aaron's original cohort by looking at data for the incremental rollout to new editors. We started by giving the visual editor to 5% of new users, then 10%, then 25%, and so on up to 100%, where the level remains. Since we applied each percentage randomly, we can incorporate some of those users into the treatment and control groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Aaron investigated the users for a week after their registration. I am expanding that to 60 days after their registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I originally performed the follow-up with the original cohort, most of the results were fairly ho-hum, but I did find one intriguing effect: the visual editor group had a higher proportion of accounts who survived to make at least one edit more than 30 days after editing."

    "# Cohort\n",
    "In all of these stages, we determined whether to offer the user the visual editor by checking the modulus of their user ID ([code for the experiment](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/68845/4/VisualEditor.hooks.php), [code for the incremental rollout](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-VisualEditor/blob/b550323b534b59622afefdf9bf9fbc23f177f46f/VisualEditor.hooks.php#L766)). In both cases, when the VE was being offered to users at x% = (1 / y ), a user got VE if ( userID % y = 0 ). Where the VE users and control users were not evenly matched, our matched control will be users where ( userID % y  = 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our groups will *not* be perfectly matched, because many of the new accounts generated at the English Wikipedia are autocreated when users with accounts on other Wikimedia projects browse over to the English Wikipedia, not when users on the English Wikipedia click the \"create account\" button. Our cohort only includes the second group, because users who already have accounts on other projects are likely to behave quite differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that our list of newly created accounts will have random gaps where autocreated accounts used up the IDs. Since they're distributed randomly, this shouldn't affect our analysis.\n",
